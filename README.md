# Baby Snake Game
This is my final project for Stanford University's online course Code in Place 2024. <br>
This python program is a simple version of the famous snake game. <br>
The program includes most of Code in Place's course lectures such as lists, loops, random library and graphics.

## Instructions
The game starts with the snake moving downwards continuosly. Player should control the snake with the  arrow keys. <br> <br>
Eating Food: <br>
Food appears randomly on the game board. Player should guide the snake to the food to eat it.<br>
Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer and a new food appears randomly on another position of the game board. <br><br>
Avoiding Collisions: <br>
Player should not let the snake run into the wall of the game area and to not collide with itself.<br><br>
Scoring: <br>
Score increases with each piece of food the snake eats. The score is usually displayed on the screen. <br><br>
Game Over: <br>
The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or its own body.

## Other Information
I am deeply thankful for the amazing learning experience during Code in Place 2024.<br>
Since I am new at Python and programming, my project is relatively straightforward and simple. <br>
I eagerly anticipate the opportunities to grow and evolve.<br><br>
Here are some images from the game <br> <br>
